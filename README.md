##  Why I Built It

In today’s competitive co-op market, staying organized can mean the difference between landing your dream placement or missing it entirely.  

I saw students juggling messy spreadsheets and sticky notes—and losing track of key deadlines.  
So I built **Co-Op Compass** to streamline the entire workflow—from research → application → interviews → offers.
